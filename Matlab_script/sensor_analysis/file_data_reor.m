%% Possible configurations
% the configurations that has been taken into account are all with the 
% logger fixed horizontally with the bigger base downstairs and the smooth 
% angle upstairs and:
%	1. the connector to the front
%	2. the connector to the back
%	3. the connector to the right
%	4. the connector to the left
% with respect to the positive turtle longitudinal axis (the one along with
% the turtle moves).

% For AGM: 
%	- accx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side. 
%	- accy is trasversal and positive to the side of the dot.
%	- accz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%	- magx is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%	- magy is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%	- magz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%	- gyrox is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%	- gyroy is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%	- gyroz is vertical and positive upstairs.

% For Axy:
