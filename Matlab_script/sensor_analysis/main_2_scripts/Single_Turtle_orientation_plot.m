% Single_Turtle_orientation_plot
% This script is demanded to handle the plot section for the firsts data
% elaborations. At the beginning, it is possible (if auto_calib_use = 0, 
% this parameter can be set at the beginning of the script main_1_raw_data) 
% to choose if to show magnetic field data before or after calibration.
%
% The plot scripts that are called from this script are the following:
%
%	1. norm_acc_mag_plot
%			plot for the norm of the measured vectors (acceleration and
%			magnetic field)
%
%	2. angle_g_mf_plot
%			plot the computed angle over time between the gravity 
%			vector (obtained as static component from the acceleration data
%			by filtering them with a low pass filter) and the measured 
%			magnetic field vector.
%
%	3. ypr_plot
%			plot of yaw, pitch and roll angles, computed in main_2_ypr 
%			script, over time.
%
% For more details, refer directly to the specific scripts by calling the
% help command (help name_of_the_script).
