function [acc_reor, mag_reor, gyro_reor]=file_data_reor(acc, mag, gyro, sensor_model)
% file_data_reor
% This function takes as input data from sensors, as accelerometer and
% gyroscope, and gives as output their reoriented version so as to obtain a
% pseudo-NED reference frame, that is:
%	- x axis along turtle carapace, positive from the tail to the head
%	- z axis positive downwards w.r.t. turtle carapace
%	- y so as to obtain a right hand frame
%
% POSSIBLE CONFIGURATIONS:
% the configurations that has been taken into account are all with the 
% logger fixed horizontally with the bigger base downstairs and the smooth 
% angle upstairs and:
%	1. the connector to the front
%	2. the connector to the back
%	3. the connector to the right
%	4. the connector to the left
% with respect to the positive turtle longitudinal axis (the one along with
% the turtle moves).
%
% REORIENT:
%	* Original raw orientation for AGM: 
%		- accx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side.
%		- accy is trasversal and positive to the side of the dot.
%		- accz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%		- magx is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%		- magy is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%		- magz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%		- gyrox is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%		- gyroy is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%		- gyroz is vertical and positive upstairs.
%
%	* Original raw orientation for Axy: 
%		- accx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side. 
%		- accy is trasversal and positive to the connector side.
%		- accz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%		- magx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side.
%		- magy is trasversal and positive to the connector side.
%		- magz is vertical and positive upstairs.
%
% INPUT:
%	acc			 - acceleration raw data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%	mag			 - magnetic field raw data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%	gyro		 - gyroscope raw data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%	sensor_model - axy-5 or AGM
%
% OUTPUT:
%	acc_reor	 - acceleration reoriented data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%	mag_reor	 - magnetic field reoriented data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%	gyro_reor	 - gyroscope reoriented data (matrix nx3, n = num of samples)
%
% NOTE:
%	gyroscope input and output are significant only for AGM sensor, in case
%	of Axy-5 sensor you can simply use acc data for gyro and ignore the
%	output.

%% Possible configurations

% For AGM: 
%	- accx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side.
%	- accy is trasversal and positive to the side of the dot.
%	- accz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%	- magx is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%	- magy is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%	- magz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%	- gyrox is longitudinal and negative along the connector side.
%	- gyroy is trasversal and negative to the side of the dot.
%	- gyroz is vertical and positive upstairs.
%
% For Axy: 
%	- accx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side. 
%	- accy is trasversal and positive to the connector side.
%	- accz is vertical and positive downstairs.
%	- magx is longitudinal and positive along the connector side.
%	- magy is trasversal and positive to the connector side.
%	- magz is vertical and positive upstairs.
%
% Lets start before by aligning all the sensors with the same reference
% frame as those of the acceletometer (for AGM, also change y axis sign of 
% acc so as to obtain a right hand reference frame).
